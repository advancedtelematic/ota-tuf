== Obtaining the binary

Binaries are compiled for each push to `master` and stored in https://tuf-cli-releases.ota.here.com/index.html[s3].

Download the archive file, unpack and run:

    tar xvf <file>
    cd garage-sign/
    bin/garage-sign --help

== Delegations

There are two actors in a delegations use case. The OEM, which owns the remote repository managed by ota-tuf, and the Supplier, which will sign metadata about a component they build.

The OEM runs garage-sign against a local repository initialized using `garage-sign init`. The changes can then be pushed as normal to a remote `ota-tuf` repository.

The Supplier runs garage-sign but does not have a local repository, instead the supplier edits metadata files using garage-sign. The resulting files can then be sent to the OEM using a secure channel (e.g. encrypted email), which adds that data to their local and remote repositories.

The basic use case for delegations works as follows.

1. The OEM manages a local repository as normal:

   garage-sign init --repo paris -c credentials-paris.zip
   garage-sign targets pull --repo paris

2. The supplier generates a key that they will use to sign their metadata:

    garage-sign user-keys gen --key-name supplier01-key --type ed25519

3. The supplier sends the *Public* part of the key to the OEM using a secure channel.

4. The OEM adds the delegation to their local targets.json, using the new key

    garage-sign targets delegations add --name supplier01 --prefix 'supplier01*' --key tuf/user-keys/supplier01-key.pub --repo paris

5. The OEM signs the new targets.json and pushes it to the remote repository:

    garage-sign targets sign --repo paris --key-name targets
    garage-sign targets push --repo paris

6. The Supplier initializes a delegations file and adds metadata about their images to the file.

    garage-sign delegations init > delegations01.json
    garage-sign delegations add-target --input delegations01.json  --inplace \
       --length 1024 \
       --name supplier01-target01.tar.gz \
       --version 0.0.1 \
       --sha256 766644289a2036c54f3485f5eae5144a08d003fc2f897de5faf8dc45bb2b0ea1 \
       --hardwareids laptop
       --url https://example.com

7. The supplier signs the delegations metadata and sends it to the OEM:

     garage-sign delegations sign --inplace --input delegations01.json --key-name supplier01-key

+
After signing the delegations the file will need to be converted back to an unsigned file to be modified, for example to add another target. This can be done with:

     jq .signed delegations01.json  > delegations01-unsigned.json

8. The OEM pushes the signed role to the remote repository:

   garage-sign delegations push --repo paris --input delegations01.json --name supplier01

9. The delegation and targets are ready for the client to validate:

   garage-sign targets pull --repo paris
   garage-sign delegations pull --repo paris --name supplier01


== Offline signing use case
// (aka PRO-3669)

1. User rotates root keys offline, see <<Rotate Root Keys>>. This
usually does not happen on the same machine where the targets are
pulled/pushed.

2. Pull targets

    garage-sign targets pull --repo myrepo

3. Add a target

   garage-sign targets add --repo myrepo \
   --format binary \
   --length 5877 \
   --name dashboards \
   --version 0.0.2 \
   --sha256 a0d3e88637d93e20e37b8eaf85fe8e8ac8ac5018337e881a452c85f8b64df0a4 \
   --hardwareids hwid01 \
   --url http://localhost/dashboards.json

4. Sign new targets.json

   garage-sign targets sign --repo myrepo --key-name <targets key used to rotate>

5. Push new targets.json

   garage-sign targets push --repo myrepo

== Rotate Root Keys

=== Rotate Repo Server Root Keys

1. Initialize a local ota-plus cache using credentials.zip downloaded
from ATS Garage:

    garage-sign init --repo myrepo --servertype reposerver --credentials credentials.zip --reposerver <reposerver uri>
+
or
+
    garage-sign init --repo myrepo --servertype reposerver --credentials credentials.zip

2. Generate new root and target keys

    garage-sign key generate --repo myrepo --name myrepo-root --type ed25519

    garage-sign key generate --repo myrepo --name myrepo-targets --type ed25519

3. Rotate Root Keys

    garage-sign move-offline --repo myrepo --new-root myrepo-root \
    --new-targets myrepo-targets --old-root-alias old-root

4. Check repository

    tree tuf/myrepo/

    tuf/myrepo
    ├── auth.json
    ├── keys
    │   ├── myrepo-root.pub
    │   ├── myrepo-root.sec
    │   ├── myrepo-targets.pub
    │   ├── myrepo-targets.sec
    │   ├── old-root.pub
    │   └── old-root.sec
    └── roles
        └── root.json

    cat tuf/myrepo/root.json

5. It is recommended that at this point you sign `targets.json` with
the new keys and upload it to reposerver, otherwise clients will get
an error when trying to validate the old `targets.json`, retrieved by
the server, with the new `root.json`.

    cat tuf/myrepo/roles/unsigned/targets.json

    # verify unsigned targets.json, this should have been pulled
    # during `rotate`.

    garage-sign targets sign --repo myrepo --key-name targets

    garage-sign targets push --repo myrepo

==== Exporting credentials

After <<Rotate Root Keys>>, you will need the new `root.json` and keys
to sign targets using `targets-sign`. If the user signing the new
targets is not the same as the user rotating the root keys, you'll
need to export the new credentials:

    garage-sign  export-credentials --repo myrepo --target-key-name targets --to creds_export.zip

=== Rotate Director Root Keys

Target keys and meta data are managed by the director even in the offline case, so they don't
need to be dealt with here.

1. Initialize a local ota-plus cache using credentials.zip downloaded
from ATS Garage:

    garage-sign init --repo myrepo --servertype director --credentials credentials.zip --reposerver <reposerver uri>
+
or
+
    garage-sign init --repo myrepo --servertype director --credentials credentials.zip

2. Generate new root key

    garage-sign key generate --repo myrepo --name myrepo-root --type ed25519

3. Rotate Root Key

    garage-sign move-offline --repo myrepo --new-root myrepo-root --old-root-alias old-root

4. Check repository

    tree tuf/myrepo/

    tuf/myrepo
    ├── auth.json
    ├── keys
    │   ├── myrepo-root.pub
    │   ├── myrepo-root.sec
    │   ├── old-root.pub
    │   └── old-root.sec
    └── roles
        └── root.json

    cat tuf/myrepo/root.json

== Finding the role JSON files

Initially you can find the signed root.json in credentials.zip which you provide when initializing the repository.

The unsigned versions of root.json and targets.json are pulled from the OTA server with `root pull` and `targets pull` respectively and are stored under __tuf/<reponame>/roles/unsigned__ path.
If you haven't previously created any targets - `targets init` will create the unsigned targets.json.

== Managing an offline root.json

A root.json can be managed entirely offline by a user using `garage-sign`.

This can be done by pulling a root with `root pull`, editing the root
using the `root key` commands, or directly editing the unsigned root
file, and signing the new root with `root sign`. The resulting root
can then be pushed to the server with `root push`.

== Client TLS Authentication support

`cli` has experimental support for authentication to a tuf repository using TLS credentials.  If the `credentials.zip` file used to initialize a repository contains a valid PKCS #12 file for client authentication, `cli` will use that certificate for authentication and ignore the `oauth` credentials.

If you already have an initialized repository, you can use the `import-client-cert` command to add a client certificate to your repository.

If you have a valid `credentials.zip` containing a client certificate, you can add this certificate to an already initialized repository using the following command

   unzip -p -l <path to credentials.zip> client_cert.p12 | garage-sign --tuf-repo ... import-client-cert --client-cert /dev/stdin

All subsequent `garage-sign` operations will use this certificate for authentication to a tuf repository.

== Appendix: Giving expiration dates on the command line

The commands `garage-sign sign root` and `garage-sign sign targets`
take the date from the unsigned metadata by default. If the date lies
in the past, they refuse to sign. The expired date can still be used in that case by
giving the option `--force`. If you want to change the date of the
signed metadata you need to give a new date with `--expires` or
`--expire-after` which also checks if it is in the past, which can
again be overwritten with `--force`.

`--expires` takes an absolute UTC instant such as _2018-01-01T00:01:00Z_.
`--expire-after` takes a relative expiration delay in years, months and days
(each optional, but in that order), such as _1Y3M5D_.

== Uploading a target binary to reposerver

The `garage-sign` tool supports uploading binary files to
reposerver. These binaries can then be easily added to the user's
targets.json.

    garage-sign targets pull --repo dev

    garage-sign targets upload --repo dev --input bigfile.bin --name name-of-target --version 0.0.2

    garage-sign targets add-uploaded --repo dev --input bigfile.bin- --name name-of-target --version 0.0.2 --hardwareids <hardware-id1>,<hardware-id2>

    garage-sign targets sign --repo dev --key-name targets

    garage-sign targets push --repo dev
